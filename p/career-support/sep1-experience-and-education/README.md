 ## How to write your experience and education?

### Work Experience
Your **work history** is the most important component of your resume. Employers will want know where you have worked, when you worked there, and what responsibilities you held in each role you have had. They will be looking to see how your experience lines up with what they are looking for in prospective employees.

 - List the jobs and internships you have held in reverse chronological order, with the most recent positions first.
 - For each position, include: job title, company, location, dates of employment, and a bulleted list of the strongest accomplishments for each job.
 - Verb tense should be present tense for your current job if you are employed, and past tense for prior employment.

#### Things to remember:
 - *Most recent experience first:* Reverse chronological order.
 - *Basic structure:* Company name, position title, date, city/state.
 - *Bullets:*
	 - *Active voice:* Start each with an action word.
	 - *Quantify:* Quantify results and scope of your work.
	 - *Skills:* Specific  skills  used  to  achieve  that  result
	 - *Order:* Stronger bullets at the top

### Education
The **education section** generally comes next. You need only to list degrees earned, with the highest first, when you have been out of school for a few years.

If you’re a student or recent graduate, the education section of your resume can be listed above your employment history. If you have work experience, list it below that section. Education should be listed in reverse chronological order, with the most recent and advanced education first. Include the name of the school, the degree earned, and the date you graduated.

Whether you include your GPA on your resume depends on how long ago you graduated and how high your GPA is.

#### Things to remember:
 - *Higher education:* Major, Minor, Institution, graduation date.
 - *Recent graduates:* Include GPA if it’s a 3.0+ and relevant  coursework.
 - *Bootcamps & Courses:* Include course/bootcamp name, Institution name, and dates.
 - *Page Positioning:* Experience is always first, unless you’re a recent graduate.
