As a developer, you are given the task to replicate a picture as a website.

## Instructions

1. Create a website that looks exactly [like this one](https://projects.breatheco.de/json?slug=instagram-feed-bootstrap&preview).
2. Start the CSS and HTML from scratch, please do not re-use from another exercise because you will end up having a mess.
3. Before starting to code make a drawing of the website will all the bootstrap components you will be using.
4. Once the components are identified start with the navbar (from top to bottom) and try adapting the examples you find on the internet to what you are asked on the picture. Don't just copy and paste, understand and tweek, if you don't understand the names of the classes used in the component you will end-up hitting a wall and being frustrated.
5. Use all the possible [bootstrap utilities (helpers)](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/utilities), take your time to read them all because it will make your life 99% easier.
6. The projects have to be 100% responsive using the bootstrap grid system.
7. Use all the possible bootstrap components, the idea is that you learn them so you can re-use them during the rest of your life.

### What to do if you are stuck?

- Clean the cache (always refresh with command+shift+R), using the incognito mode on Google Chrome. 
- Look in google for solutions. 
- Talk to the other students. 
- Talk to senior developers you know. 
- Talk to the mentors over slack.

### What **NOT** to do if you are stuck?

- Don't get frust rated and think you are not good at this: All the developers get stuck all the time, ask around! How do you know if you are good at something that you don't know? 
Coding is a science, facts matter and you have no facts. 
- Don't Keep wondering around for hours without seeking help: Google is only as useful as you are good at googling, please speak to other students or your instructors. 
- Change strategy: Einstein once said, if you do the same stuff you will get the same results.
