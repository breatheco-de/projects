### Projects Section
The **projects** section is instrumental in demonstrating your technical expertise in real world settings.

Strategically **select two to three projects** that you are particularly proud of and demonstrate the breadth of your technical expertise or highlight different skills and competencies.

Make sure to **include working links to GitHub** to all your project's live demos and that the code is accessible for potential review, the code must have a README.md file with ~500 words about the project: What it does, technologies used and interesting challenges you had to overcome when developing it. And lastly, it is recommended to add a small animated GIF demonstration like this one:
