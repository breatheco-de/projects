### Summary Statement Section
A **summary statement** is a short paragraph that highlights your professional skills and experience. It gives hiring managers a glimpse into your expertise before diving into your resume. The goal of a summary statement is to demonstrate your unique value through your professional story, your skills, and accomplishments.

As hiring managers may read through hundreds of resumes in a week, a strong summary statement can be just what you need to stand out from the pack.

If you have relevant work experience, keep your summary super short. The piece you really want the hiring manager reading is your most recent work experience.

The summary statement is just a “bridge” to get the hiring manager into your experience.

However, if you’re  changing careers or you’re looking for jobs without any work experience, the summary section needs to stand on its own, and should be longer.

### Things to remember:

 - This is the opportunity to showcase your strengths in light of the type of job you want to target.
 - Keep your summary short if you have relevant work experience.
 - Make sure to talk about your strenghts, tops skills, and accomplishments.
