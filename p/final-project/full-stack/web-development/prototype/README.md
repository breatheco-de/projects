The best way to experiment how your product will be used, is actually using it. Right? :)

Lets build a prototipe by coding our most important pages using CSS, HTML, Bootstrap and React Components.

## Steps
1. Focus only on your ~3 most important pages
2. Build your HTML and CSS based on the Wireframe
3. Once the HTML is finished, move everything to React.js components
4. Connect your components using React Router.
5. Create a repository and upload everything to it.
