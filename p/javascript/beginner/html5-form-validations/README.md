# ![alt text](https://assets.breatheco.de/apis/img/images.php?blob&random&cat=icon&tags=breathecode,32)  HTML5 Form Validations

After building the HTML and CSS for this form, we need to make sure it prevents the user from submitting a form with the wrong information or format, in web development we call that: Form Validations.

To prevent a form submission we have to listen to the "submit" event that is triggered by the form itself when the user presses either: the enter/return key or the submit button.

Here is a little more about preventing an event from occurring: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_fVO_NzT2g&t=401s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_fVO_NzT2g&t=401s)

## Instructions

After the user submits the form:
1. Make sure to stop the flow of the submission using `preventDevault()`, [here is a little bit more about preventDefault()](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SNyh57XSIA).
2. After preventing the submission make sure all the input values are correct and properly formatted.
3. If there are one or more inputs with an invalid value, show a clear error on the top of the form with a very explicit message about what happened.
2. Change the background color of the relevant inputs (the ones with incorrect data).
