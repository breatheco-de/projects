# The Domain Name Generator

Finding a domain name is hard, why not automate it? :)

## Instructions

Create a script that generate all the possible domain name combinations
from a list of pronouns, adjectives and nouns, for example:

```
  var pronoun = ['the','our'];
  var adj = ['great', 'big' ];
  var noun = ['jogger','racoon'];
```

Should generate something like:

```
thegreatjogger.com
thegreatracoon.com
ourgreatjogger.com
ourgreatracoon.com
thebigjogger.com
thebigracoon.com
ourbigjogger.com
ourbigracoon.com
```

Hint: you'll need to use nested for loops in order to mix the different values together.

Your tools: For loop, string concatenation.

## A bit of history about the project (read only if you care)

Before the domain market was centralized and converted into a mafia 
controlled by Godaddy, Enom and some others. Earsth citizends like you and me 
were able to buy a .com domain realtively easy. 

In fact, this project was originally built in 2002 by one of 4Geeks teachers 
while he was trying to find domain names to buy for several projects.
