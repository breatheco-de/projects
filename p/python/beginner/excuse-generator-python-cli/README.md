## The Goal

We wanted a project that used very little Python but still with a very fun application, the excuse generator takes 20 lines of code, is super simple to understand and is the perfect first-ish project for any beginner developer.

## Instructions

Please create a python script  that generates an excuse each time it is runned.

## Discuss with your classmates the strategy first

How can we generate an excuse? How are sentences build?

![Excuse generator explanation](https://github.com/breatheco-de/projects/blob/master/p/javascript/beginner/excuse-generator/explanation.gif?raw=true)

The idea is to generate each part of the sentence randomly to come up with great excuses!

## Hint

1. Create a `app.py` file with one excuse hard-coded in one variable.
2. The excuse must be in a variable:
```python
excuse = 'The dog eat my homework when I finished'
```
3. Using javascript, create a function that generates and returns a random excuse with the following structure:
```python
who = ['the dog','my granma','his turtle','my bird']
what = ['eat','pissed','crushed','broked']
when = ['before the class','right in time','when I finished','during my lunch','while I was praying']
```
4. To create a consistent excuse you have to concatenate one item from each array in the proper order.
5. Print the excuse on the console using the `print` function.


## Technologies

Python.

## Fundamentals
This exercise covers the following fundamentals:
1. Running python files.
2. How to work with Lists (arrays).
3. Generating random numbers.
4. Concatenating strings.
5. Using functions (at least a bit).
