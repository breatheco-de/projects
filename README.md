<h1 align="center"> BreatheCode's Project-Exercises Pool </h1>

By now, everybody knows that learning to code has to be a practical experience: No much reading or watching videos, but choosing projects its still one of the bigges limitations in students learning process because of the following reasons:

- Bad instructions: Making them harder to complete or start.
- Boring projects: Students loose motivation because they don't identify with the project.
- To dificult for your current level: How do I know if I will be able to finish it?
- Old technologies: There are too much projects out there, the majority in old deprecated technologies.
- What do I do if I'm stuck in the middle of the project? There is not model solution or video tutorial to help me.

## What is this?

We have decided to create a database of projects for people learning to code. We want to invite anyone to contribute and upload projects using the following guide: [Submiting a project](https://github.com/breatheco-de/projects/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Once your Pull-Request is approved it will be automatically published as part of the pool in the [following link](https://projects.breatheco.de).

## The projects API

All projects in the pool are also automatically published in the following JSON API: 

HOST: [https://projects.breatheco.de/json](https://projects.breatheco.de/json)
